Calculations were made with Non-Crossing Approximation (NCA) and Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG Ljubljana). The addition of a magnetic onsite anisotropy unveil the topological characteristics of the non-Landau Fermi liquid. This new phase is one of my current line of research.\nRaman response: calculation of raman vertex from DFT+DMFT calculations. .",

During this time I was responsible of teaching physics to several levels, but also worked on the training of students to participate on the national stage of the Science Olympiad and the Physics Olympiad. In 2019 I was the leader of the Argentinian team in the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO).\nSince May 2014 up to 2020, I worked as Teaching Assistant at the Physics degree of the Faculty of Natural Science, Engineering and Surveying (FCEIA) part of the National University of Rosario (UNR). During this time, I worked on and introduction to the computer (Linux, gnuplot, LibreOffice) and programming (Fortran), and on Computational Physics were topics as digital image processing, neural networks, other machine learning techniques and parallelization were introduced, using C or Python.\nDuring 2020 I was also the responsible professor for the electrical engineering students of Introduction to Physics and Physics 1 in the same faculty FCEIA-UNR.\n\n\nDuring this process, I participate on some research in the field of physics education related with the areas and levels I was involved at the moment. Some of this research is reflected in the following publications:\n\nWhy are we not teaching machine learning at high school? A proposal\nI. Evangelista, G. Blesio, E.
